This project is a React-based course blog application that replicates the design of the course navigation and
content display found on GUVI Blogs. The application features a navigation menu that allows users to switch
between different course categories and displays the relevant content in cards. Each card includes an image,
course title, and a button linking to more details.

Features
Navigation Bar: A custom-designed navigation bar that allows users to filter courses based on categories like Full Stack Development, Data Science, Cyber Security, Career, etc.
Dynamic Routing: Implemented using react-router-dom to handle client-side routing and display content based on the selected category.
Course Cards: Each course is displayed in a card format, containing an image, course title, and a button that links to more information.
Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
